# TokenBasedAuthentication

# TokenAuthenticationCode

PURPOSE:
This project's aim is to generate the API token, which will be used for the authentication.
Valididity of the token is 7 days from the date of generate of the token, after which it will expire and then the user cannot access the application.

How to use the API
=================

The API can be tested in the Postman or in the browser by entering the URL e.g. http://localhost:57512/token. 
First need to pass the data for creationg of the user and generate the token.
The data need to pass to the following fields:
userName:
password:
grant_type:

The above first two fields are common for the user registration, while third one is for the role type (where it could be an Admin, or User).

Testing the token authentication
================================
The API token can be tested by simply passing the token generated by above API URL. If the token is verified, it will display the data. Otherwise it will display a message.

The validity of the token is for 7 day from the date of generate, after it will expire.
